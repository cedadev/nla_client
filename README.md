# nla_client

A command line client to access the near-line archive (NLA).

Whilst much of the CEDA archive is stored on disk we do not have the storage capacity to keep it all online. We therefore migrate many data sets on to tape. If the data you require is held on tape then you can use the near-line archive (NLA) tool to request the files are restored to disk.

See the documentation at: http://nla.ceda.ac.uk/nla_control/docs/ for more information about NLA.

The NLA system github is at: https://github.com/cedadev/django-nla_control
